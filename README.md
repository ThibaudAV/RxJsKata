# RxJsKata

The aim of this kata is to have a grasp on concepts and tools that are mandatory woking on a real life RX application.  
It is highly recommended to have gone through the excellent [RxJs Koans](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJSKoans/) before doing this kata. Speaking ow which, technical pre requisites, installation process for this kata are the same than the ones for RxJs Koans.  

Doing this kata you might learn things on:
1. the different types of observables, hot and cold
2. test schedulers and time virtualisation
3. putting all together with exercices involving several Rx operators

As with RxJs koans, the kata begins with simple exercices with "__" placeholders. These exercices should give you understanding on hot/cold concepts and get you familiar with test scheduler.  
The second part of this kata is made of 3 more complex exercices. On these exercices, a chunk of code, transforming Rx streams, need to be written in order to get existing unit tests running successfully.
