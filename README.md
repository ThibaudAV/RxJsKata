# RxJsKata

This is a kata on RxJS inspired from [RxJs Koans](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJSKoans/). Installation process, technical pre requisites are similar to those of RxJS Koans.  
This kata is focused on testing and hence doing this kata you should get up to speed with test schedulers, but not only... There is several parts in this kata:
- first simple exercices on cold and hot observables
- then focus on test schedulers
- last but not least 3 exercices, of growing complexity, that requires the usages of several Rx operators
